simple set of javascript commands

-- Set Up --
To set up, add a form with 2 inputs and a button.

2 text inputs with the ids: title and desc and then a button with the onclick attribute set to newTicket()

also requires 2 blank divs with the ids: textArea and completedArea

optional clear button with the clearList() function as it's onclick event

requires jQuery and my example uses bootstrap but that is optional
